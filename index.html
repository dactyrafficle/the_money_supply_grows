    <h4> observations </h4>
    <p> the government issues bonds, slowly, over time, to raise money to spend </p>
    <p> the central bank buys bonds, to increase the money supply, to keep pace with the growing economy </p>
    <p> the government and the central bank could work together tho, couldn't they ? </p>
    <p> prices will be fixed in the short term, but over time, they will change </p>

    <h4> model complexity </h4>
    <ul>
      <li><p> what happens if later on, someone finds something with value (ie. finds copper?) </p>
      <li><p> what if someone cuts down a tree for wood, makes a house ? </p>
      <li><p> what if someone catches fish ? someone buys that fish and cooks it, and sells that ? </p>
      <li><p> are people just making up prices, ie. how much to sell the cooked fish ? ie. i spent 2h fishing, and 2h cooking = 4h, and i could have made 10 loaves of bread with that but theres risk in fishing, so maybe i think the cooked fish are worth 13 loaves of bread. and price them accordingly ? </p>
      <li><p> when the village makes their money, do they have enough for everything in the economy? all the assets (wealth) ? or the income ? how much. in that case, i really need to know what is the total demand in a given period of time. that is how much money we need </p>
    </ul>
    <p> profit. taxes. interest. price volatility. </p>
    <p> i wont even try to go past the handful of transactions i have so far. it more or less shows how the money supply grows. at this point the economy has a life of its own. people do their own thing with prices and so on. </p>
