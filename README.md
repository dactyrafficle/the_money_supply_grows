the money supply grows

im trying to understand some basic things about the money supply

when i studied economics, i was very confused about how the money supply grew. and whenever i asked, everyone said 'the central bank does open market operations (omo) and buys bonds on the open market'.

i always thot that was a very bad answer. and i was very confused (and still am confused) as to why no one else seems to think that is a very bad answer.

it seems to me that it is only one part of the answer. and that you need at least 4 players to make it work.

1. consumers (to buy bonds from the government, to sell bonds to the central bank, and borrow money from commercial banks)
2. a government (to create bonds, and sell them to consumers)
3. a central bank (to issue an initial currency, and to buy bonds from consumers)
4. commercial banks (to lend money to consumers, and act as an intermediary between the central bank and consumers)

so i will play around with this, and see if i learn anything interesting
